# Stuff I could write about in the future
- Python constructors
  - __init__ vs __new__
  - Formal names
  - [inheriting __new__](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10788976/how-do-i-properly-inherit-from-a-superclass-that-has-a-new-method)
  - [using __new__ vs __init__](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/674304/pythons-use-of-new-and-init)
  - ["Classes are callable."](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy)
    - Callable objects
    - Neither constructor nor functor (C++) is referenced in this documentation
  - Constructor mentioned in [FAQ](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html?highlight=constructor), functor is not
  - I use the word constructor because it looks like a constructor, it feels like a constructor, so why not use it as a constructor (duck typing).
